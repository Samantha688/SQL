CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS exam (
  student_id int(6) NOT NULL,
  subject varchar(100) NOT NULL,
  mark int(4) NOT NULL
);


INSERT INTO exam (student_id, subject, mark) VALUES
(1, "history", 80),
(2, "history", 75),
(2, "math", 50),
(3, "math", 64),
(1, "english", 88),
(2, "english", 72),
(3, "english", 57);


Write an SQL query to find the student(s) who has more than one subject with marks higher than the average mark of that subject among all students. 

OR you can break it down into the following sub-questions: 
1.  Find the average mark of each subject
2.  Combine the exam table and the table made in 1
3.  Find for each student, which subject whose mark is higher than average for that subject
4.  Find the student(s) who has more than one subject with marks higher than the average mark of that subject among all students, showing only student id

Result format:
+------+-------------+
|      | student_id  |
|------+-------------+
|  1   |             |
|  2   |             |            
+------+-------------+
